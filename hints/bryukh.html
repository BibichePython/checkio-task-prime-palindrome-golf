        You can increase the number and check if it's prime and if it's also a palindrome.

<pre class="brush: python">
while true:
    number += 1
    if is_prime(number) and is_palindrome(number):
        return number
</pre>

    <div class="answer">
        Checking if it's a palindrome is pretty simple:

<pre class="brush: python">
if str(number) == reversed(str(number)):
    OR
if str(number) == str(number)[::-1]:
</pre>
    </div>

        I have gone half way through. Need help!

    <div class="answer">
        To check if it's prime can be also very simple, but this simple way is dumb and slow.
<pre class="brush: python">
for i in range(2, number):
    if not number % i:
        # NOT PRIME
</pre>
    </div>

        If you want to get points, then you will need to shorten your code. Use one symbol variable
        names for example, and remove redundant spaces where you can.
